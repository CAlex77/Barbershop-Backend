// NOTE: This file used to declare SecurityConfig but that class now lives in
// src/main/kotlin/com/barbershop/backend/config/SecurityConfig.kt and includes
// @EnableMethodSecurity. Keeping this file as a stub to avoid duplicate class
// declarations. If you prefer, you can delete this file entirely.

// No active class in this file to prevent Kotlin redeclaration error.
